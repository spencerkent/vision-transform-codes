vision-transform-codes
======================
A set of implementations of different image transform codes (sparse coding, ICA, PCA, etc.) to facilitate comparison between them.
The implementation is in the PyTorch GPGPU framework and should be relatively performant in terms of wall-clock time for training
and inference. The modular organization is to stress the interchangibility of different techniques for code inference (analysis)
and reconstruction (synthesis).
